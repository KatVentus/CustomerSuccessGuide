# Service Levels

## Definitions

Due to the nature and scope of requests that we receive, we have clasified our service levels into four categories. 

### Severity 1 (Critical)
Severity 1 is defined as critical production issues that severely impacts the vertical's use of the service. This situation halts business operations and no procedural workaround exists. An example of this would be if the site is down.

### Severity 2 (Major)
Major functionality is impacted or significant performance degradation is experienced. The situation is causing a high impact to portions of your business and no reasonable workaround exists. Service is operational but highly degraded to the point of major impact usage. An example of this would be if the site is unable to accept PayPal payments but still able to accept other payment methods.

### Severity 3 (Minor)
There is a partial, non-critical loss of use of the service with medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function. Short-term workaround is available, but not scalable.

### Severity 4 (Cosmetic)

Inquiry regarding a routine technical issue; information requested on application capabilities, navigation or configuration; bug affecting a small number of users. Acceptable workaround available.
