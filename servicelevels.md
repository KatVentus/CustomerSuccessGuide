# Service Levels

Due to the nature and scope of requests that we receive, we have clasified our service levels into four categories. 

### Severity 1 (Critical)
Severity 1 is defined as critical production issues that severly impacts the vertical's use of the service.  This situation halts business operations and no procedural workaround exists.
