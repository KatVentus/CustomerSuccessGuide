# Service Levels

Due to the nature and scope of requests that we receive, we have clasified our service levels into four categories. 

### Severity 1 (Critical)
Severity 1 is defined as critical production issues that severly impacts the vertical's use of the service.  This situation halts business operations and no procedural workaround exists.  An example of this would be if the site is down.

### Severity 2 (Major)
Major functionality is impacted or significant performance degradation is experienced.  The situation is causing a high impact to portions of your business and no reasonable workaround exists.  Service is operational but highlfy degraded to the point of major impact usage.

### Severity 3 (Minor)

### Basic Plan
